Goals. The goal of this assignment is to learn how to write a lexical analyzer for the C programming language.

DO. Complete the "get_token" function in the clex.py program so that the program enumerates all tokens in the "clex.c" program.

DON'T. Do not use any lexical analyzer generators (e.g., flex). This assignment is self-contained in that you can complete this assignment by inserting statements inside the "get_token" function. It is acceptable to define your own functions inside the "clex.py" file.

Template files. The /class/ec3204/2015/assn1 directory contains the following template files to begin with:

    README.txt: the documentation file
    clex.py: the scanner template
    gcd.c: a short input file
    gcd.tokens.txt: the output file
    clex.c: a long input file
    clex.tokens.txt: the output file

Submitting files through the turnin system. Use the turnin submission system to submit your work:
